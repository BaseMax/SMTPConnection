# SMTP Connection

A script to connect to a SMTP and send email using that.

## Purpose

It's my experience with working with different smtp servers.
It was for a official Office.

The main problem is for verify the SSL Certificate.

## Tools

We had been tested many tools.
Same as:

- [PHP + PHPMailer](PHPMailer/send.php)
- Own tools
- NodeJs
- PHP
